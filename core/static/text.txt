This site has been created to offer a new way to create and manage short URLs. To create one, just type <b>lzy.su/</b> before URL in your browser's address bar, wherever you are.<br><br> For example: <b><span class="text-primary">lzy.su/</span><span class="text-danger">https://google.com</span></b> and you will get short version of the URL. Yes it sounds unusual but if you try it out, you will like it.<br><br> You can also delete the short URL and get some statistics typing commands in the address bar. Just create one LazyUrl and you will find out more.
