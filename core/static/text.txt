This site has been created to offer a new way to create and manage short URLs. To create one, just type <b>lzy.su/</b> before the URL in your browser's address bar, wherever you are. For example: <b><span class="text-primary">lzy.su</span><span class="text-danger">/https://google.com</span></b> and you will get short version of URL. Yes it sounds unusual but if you try it out you will like it. You can also delete URL and get some statistics typing the commands in the address bar. Just create one LazyUrl and you will find out more.
